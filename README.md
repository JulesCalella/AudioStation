## Description
Audio Station firmware is written in C and uses a 16-bit PIC microcontroller to process audio. Music can be written and stored on the board for continuous playback. The user interface includes 6 LEDs as well as 9 buttons and 5 potentiometers for complete control. Additional I/O pins are offered to provide more functionality if desired.

## Uploading the Code
The code is uploaded to the board using the Pickit debugger. It is attached to the programmer pins located at the edge of the device. The code can be opened and compiled in MPLAB X IDE. 

## User Interaction
Buttons are used to control playback and tempo, as well as other various functions. Knobs are used to control volume. LEDs will display tempo and errors during development.

## Dependencies
No dependencies required.

## Contributing
